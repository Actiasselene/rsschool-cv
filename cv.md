# Summary

Having graduated as a quality engineer, I have always been interested in the graphical component of various projects. Later, after graduating as a graphic designer, I worked for a firm as a designer doing 3D and graphic design. I got a lot of experience in different graphic editors, as I always had different tasks. It always interesting for me to learn more about different opportunities and gain new experience and learn something new and apply this knowledge later in my work.

For the last 10 years I have been working as a freelancer designer and illustrator. I took courses for UX design and I wanted to learn more. At the moment, I would like to focus on the profession of a front-end developer, because I like to see the result of my work and I can use and improve the experience I already have.
